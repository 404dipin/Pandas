Before manipulating the data you must know how to do these things
1.select specific column
2.Filter rows
3.combine multiple conditions

solution
1. To select any specific column use square bracket to access them 
colunm=df["column_Name"] for selecting one column
For selecting multiple column at a time
subset=df["column1","column2","column3","..."]


2. To filter rows use boolean conditions
based on single condition
row_filter=df[df["column_Name]>50000]

multiple conditions
row_filter=df[(df["column_name"]>50000)&(df["column_Name]<80000)]
