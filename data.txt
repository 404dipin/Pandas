why do we need to explore the data???
1. To understand the data sets
i.e. how many rows,column are present in that data and what are the names of the column,types of data....

2.Identifying the problems
i.e. Finding and checking the missing data, checking for the incorrect data types,check for duplicate data....

3.Plan next steps
